# 浅谈Java中的URL类

# 构造函数

首先是两个参数的构造方法，它描述了 URL 字符串的构成规则：<scheme>://<authority><path>?<query>#<fragment> ， 里面可以兼容的不仅仅只是 http 协议，还有如 ftp ,file , jar 等；然后是授权路径，也就是我们的权威域名，其次是查询参数，片段，

```java
    /**
     * Creates a URL by parsing the given spec within a specified context.
     *
     * The new URL is created from the given context URL and the spec
     * argument as described in
     * RFC2396 &quot;Uniform Resource Identifiers : Generic * Syntax&quot; :
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *          &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;authority&gt;&lt;path&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * The reference is parsed into the scheme, authority, path, query and
     * fragment parts. If the path component is empty and the scheme,
     * authority, and query components are undefined, then the new URL is a
     * reference to the current document. Otherwise, the fragment and query
     * parts present in the spec are used in the new URL.
     * <p>
     * If the scheme component is defined in the given spec and does not match
     * the scheme of the context, then the new URL is created as an absolute
     * URL based on the spec alone. Otherwise the scheme component is inherited
     * from the context URL.
     * <p>
     * If the authority component is present in the spec then the spec is
     * treated as absolute and the spec authority and path will replace the
     * context authority and path. If the authority component is absent in the
     * spec then the authority of the new URL will be inherited from the
     * context.
     * <p>
     * If the spec's path component begins with a slash character
     * &quot;/&quot; then the
     * path is treated as absolute and the spec path replaces the context path.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, the path is treated as a relative path and is appended to the
     * context path, as described in RFC2396. Also, in this case,
     * the path is canonicalized through the removal of directory
     * changes made by occurrences of &quot;..&quot; and &quot;.&quot;.
     * <p>
     * For a more detailed description of URL parsing, refer to RFC2396.
     *
     * @param      context   the context in which to parse the specification.
     * @param      spec      the {@code String} to parse as a URL.
     * @exception  MalformedURLException  if no protocol is specified, or an
     *               unknown protocol is found, or {@code spec} is {@code null},
     *               or the parsed URL fails to comply with the specific syntax
     *               of the associated protocol.
     * @see        java.net.URL#URL(java.lang.String, java.lang.String,
     *                  int, java.lang.String)
     * @see        java.net.URLStreamHandler
     * @see        java.net.URLStreamHandler#parseURL(java.net.URL,
     *                  java.lang.String, int, int)
     */
    public URL(URL context, String spec) throws MalformedURLException {
        this(context, spec, null);
    }
